# Mock-online-banking-system
A fun project practicing JavaScript by making an online banking system

Overall description:
1. The project has a UI built only using HTML and CSS
2. The UI follows the layout of ANZ's online banking system on desktop
3. There are 3 accoutns: a cheque account, an online account, all in NZD, and lastly, an USD account where the exchange rate is aligned with the exchange rate real-time, by using an API.
4. The online account has a interest rate of 20% every 10 seconds.
5. All accounts can display balance, transaction date, time, payee.
6. The initial balance for the NZD accounts is $1,000,000.
7. The balance of the USD account will be $0 initially, but users can transfer money into the USD account. The NZD amount will be converted into USD at real-time exchange rate, and a conversion fee will be charged (4% of NZD amount)
8. User can pay other people on this system, the transaction will be recorded and displayed on the balance sheet of the account used to pay. (There will not be another user receiving the payment as there is no back-end of this project)
9. Play around with your money, millionaire!
